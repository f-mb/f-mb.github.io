	|	template-customize.css



#### Create Page

Create a "index.html" file (use code in "template-index.html").

You can subdivise sections using h2, h3 and h4 headings. 

For new menus, sections or social links, the following icons are included in RedLight:

<img src="icons/icons.jpg"/>

#### Customize Layout

By default, RedLight use a grey-based layout; but you can customize it.

To do so, create a "customize.css" file (use code in "template-customize.css"; do not delete "!important" mentions!).

No other action needed. The "customize.css" will be automatically load by RedLight.

*Recommandation:* Use only one different color, called "On Color" in "template-customize.css".


#### File Architecture

The newly created files should be upload at your main web folder (as any other file, like pictures, pgp keys etc.); while Redlight library should be upload in a subfolder named "redlight".
