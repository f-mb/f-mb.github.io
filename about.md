	<h4>I am a legal scholar, a technologist and a creative.</h4>

	<p>I am currently an Assistant Professor of Law and Technology at the <a href="http://commonlaw.uottawa.ca" target="_blank">Faculty of Law, Common Law Section</a> and Director of the <a href="http://techlaw.uottawa.ca" target="_blank">Centre for Law, Technology and Society</a> at the University of Ottawa.</p>
	
	<p>I am completing a LL.D. (Doctor of Laws) in IP and IT law at Université de Montréal, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.gautrais.com/vincent/bio/">Vincent Gautrais</a>. My dissertation is "Rethinking Trademark Right: A Functional Approach Essay on Marks in a Global and Digital World." The manuscript was submitted on August 2016.</p>
	
	<p>Previously, I was a Lecturer at the Faculty of Law and at the Department of Computer Sciences (DIRO), Université de Montréal, as well as Coordinator of <a href="https://openum.ca/en/" target="_blank">OpenUM</a> and the <a href="http://www.chairelrwilson.ca/en/" target="_blank">L.R. Wilson Chair in Information Technology and Electronic Commerce Law</a>. In Spring 2015, I was named <em>Internet Policy Global Fellow</em> at the <a href="http://www.itsrio.org" target="_blank">Institute of Technology and Society at Rio de Janeiro (Brazil)</a>.</p>
	
	
	<p>As a legal scholar, my research focuses on Intellectual Property and Information Technology Law; with a special interest for Trade-marks (thesis subject), I aim to explain and rethink law in the digital era.
	If my researches and other academic activities consume most of my time, reading and sometimes <a href="/writings">writing</a> academic materials, I used to be a developer and creative/publicist (see "My other life" bellow).
	I still use these skills to spread researches into legal and non-legal world (with OpenUM); and also for ‘side’ projects. But it certainly gives me a different point of view on legal issues regarding IT!</p>
	
	
	<p>I hold a <em>Licence</em> and a <em>Maitrise</em> in Business Law, and a Master in Intellectual Property and Information Technology Law from Université d'Aix-Marseille (France). I also hold a Certificate in Criminal Law, Criminology and Forensic Sciences and a Certificate in Legal and Moral Sciences. In Winter 2013, I was a Graduate Visiting Student in Intellectual Property at McGill University.</p>
	
	<p>Over the past decade, I have held several positions as Chair or board member of various non-profit organizations, in Canada and in France. I also served as Vice-President for Student Affaires of Université Paul-Cézanne Aix-Marseille III from 2008 to 2011. From 2011 to 2012, I have been a junior lecturer at the Faculty of Law and Politics of Université d’Aix-Marseille.</p>
	
				<p><strong>My other life</strong></p>
				<p>In a nutshell, I'm a lover of technology, media, communications and advertising, who decided to enroll in Law instead of IT or communication, ‘learning’ that by myself.</p>
				<p>I started coding in the 1990's, on a GridLite-like "laptop" running MsDos... In late 1990's, I learned programming with Visual Studio, and HTML. Over the years, I focused on web-apps and websites working with ASP, PHP, MySQL, HTML, XML, CSS, XLS and JavaScript. Today, I mostly code for themes, frameworks and plugins running on a WordPress core. I also contribute to translate some website content or improve open-source apps I use.</p>
				<p>Since 1998, I have designed web site, communication supports, campaigns, identities and managed public relations. Mostly for non-for-profit organizations, but my references also include educational organizations, law firms, museums and small corporations. Most of my work has been released under the signature <a href="http://ilix.net">ILIX</a>. Some of my works has been featured on local and national press, radio and tv.</p>
				<p>I currently live in Ottawa ON.</p>
